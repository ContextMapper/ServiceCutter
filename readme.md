The services toolkit consists of the following components:

* Engine - the REST API (Spring Boot, Jersey)
* Editor - a Web App to Edit the model (JHipster)

## Docker

All components can be started using docker.

```
docker-compose up
```

All docker images need to be built using Maven before using docker-compose.
